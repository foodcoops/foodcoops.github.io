Also some fixes and smaller features wandered into this release.

The most notable changes are:

- Update Ruby to 2.7 and Rails to 7.0
- Introduce Message Formatting with Actiontext Trix Editor
- Disable member list via configuration
- Add Turkish language support
- Add admin UI for SupplierCategories
- Add BankGateway
