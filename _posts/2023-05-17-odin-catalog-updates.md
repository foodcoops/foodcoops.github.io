title: Automatic product catalog updates for Odin are working again
categories: hosting

At the global hosting platform we provide for some suppliers a shared product catalog database.
Because it's updated automatically each Foodcoop which is using the database can save a lot of time.

We're happy to accounce that [Odin](https://www.odin.nl/) is sending their weekly catalog updates to
our system again. So no more manually editing products and prices.
