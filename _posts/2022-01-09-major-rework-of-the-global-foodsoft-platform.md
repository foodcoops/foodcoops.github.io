title: Major rework of the global Foodsoft platform
categories: hosting
---

Over the last weeks we updated our global Foodsoft platform to make maintenance and
customizations easier. As a side effect there are two new features for our users:

- You can now reply directly by e-mail to messages that have been sent
  via your Foodsoft. If you click on "Reply" in your e-mail client the individual
  reply address of the message will be automatically selected.
- We can make your Foodsoft instance accessible via your own domain. If
  you are interested in this, send a message to
  [support@lists.foodcoops.net](mailto:support@lists.foodcoops.net).
