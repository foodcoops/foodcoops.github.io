For quite some years our support and developement forums were hosted at [Nabble](https://nabble.com/).
Because of the antique interface and some questionable political statements from a Nabble administrator we moved the forums away.

Say welcome to our new [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) forums at https://forum.foodcoops.net. All previous topics and user data have been preserved.
Discourse brings a fresh look to this support channel and hopefully it animates you to contribute to it by adding new topics or answering questions of other Foodsoft users.
