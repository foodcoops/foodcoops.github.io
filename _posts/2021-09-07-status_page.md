Our newly created status page will inform you about problems with our Foodsoft hosting.
Please have a look at [status.foodcoops.net](https://status.foodcoops.net) if you experience any problems before
[contacting](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/wiki/Support) us.

This status page is part of our [monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_monitor)
that automatically creates notifications about downtimes and other problems.
