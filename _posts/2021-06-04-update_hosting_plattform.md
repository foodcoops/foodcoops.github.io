title: Update to our global hosting plattform
categories: hosting

Some of you may experienced a "504 Gateway Timeout" error when using the Foodsoft over the last few months. We believe that the main reason for this kind
of annoying error was a lack of performance of the server behind our global hosting plattform.

Today we updated the server to a more recent model. We are confident that the errors are gone now. As we have to pay a higher monthly fee for the new server we
kindly ask you to support us by [donating](https://foodcoops.net/global-foodsoft-platform/#costs) on a regular basis. About EUR 10 per year per Foodcoop are very
welcome.
