title: New foodcoops website
categories: general
---
This is the new website of Foodsoft, software for food cooperatives. Currently
it is hosted at [foodcoops.github.io](https://foodcoops.github.io/), but it
will move to [foodcoops.net](http://foodcoops.net/) in the course of the next
months.

Long overdue, this is the central place where you can learn about what the Foodsoft is
about. News here will be related to the development of the software, and hopefully
also about how different groups and communities are using it.

Just like the Foodsoft is an open source project by different persons, so is this
website: if you see anything to improve, feel free to either
[open an issue](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/issues/new) mentioning the website,
or suggest a change in the site's [Github repository](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodcoops.github.io).
