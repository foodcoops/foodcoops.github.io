title: Call for donations 2021
categories: hosting

An essential principle of the Foodsoft hosting offer is that all foodcoops share the
costs incurred among themselves. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity
to send a big thank you to all of our previous donors!

With this call we want to start a new donation campaign. Our goal is raise EUR 500.

If your foodcoop has not yet donated, we are looking forward to your contribution.
Our  recommendation is a donation of EUR 20 per foodcoop.

Have a look at [this page](http://foodcoops.net/call-for-donations) for more information.
