title: Custom settings for Foodsoft instances
categories: hosting
---

At [app.foodcoops.net](https://app.foodcoops.net) we serve multiple Foodsoft instances with a feature called *multi coop*. So far we used a single configuration [file](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/blob/master/config/app_config.yml.SAMPLE) for all instances. This meant that individual settings per Foodsoft instance were not possible. Until now.

We changed our setup to enable custom settings per instance. Have a look at [this](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodcoops.net/blob/master/Ansible/roles/foodsoft/Configuration.md) page to get to know all possible settings. If you want us to enable some settings please send us an [email](mailto:hosting@foodcoops.net).
