Interested to see how the Foodsoft looks like? You're welcome to try out a
demonstration site. Please feel free to play around, but keep the default
accounts and passwords the same, so that others can try it as well.

Since different food cooperatives may function in different ways, there are
several versions of the Foodsoft in use. Also, you can try out the configuration
screen to turn some functionality on or off.


## Main version

The [global platform](/global-foodsoft-platform) provides a [demo](https://app.foodcoops.net/demo/)
of the main version of the Foodsoft. All data are reset daily at midnight.

## Foodcoop-adam

Some cooperatives in The Netherlands are using a modified version of the Foodsoft
(the [foodcoop-adam fork](https://github.com/foodcoop-adam/foodsoft)). You can
try out the [foodcoop-adam demo](https://order.voedselcollectief.org/foodsoft/demo).
