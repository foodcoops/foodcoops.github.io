*Note: This document is work in progress. The final version will not contain this note.*

This document describes how we provide the global hosting service. What data we need to provide a
Foodsoft instance and how we use it. This document also describes under what conditions we may
terminate your instance and asserts our limited liability. Your use of the global hosting platform
constitutes your agreement to these Terms of Service.

## Privacy Policy

To provide the global hosting service we need to know some information about you and your foodcoop.
We retain only the bare minimum of information about you or your foodcoop that is required to make
the service work. We do not sell or share any of it.

### Registration information

To setup a new instance we need to know the following personal data:
 
 - Your name and your email address
 - The name and email address of another contact person

We will add this data to a mailing list which we use to send out important information about the service.
Such messages may contain (but are not limited to) information about updates, outages or call for donations.

### Help requests

Our support mailing list [support@lists.foodcoops.net](mailto:support@lists.foodcoops.net) contains a
private archive. Only members of the support team and the mailing list provider can access the data.

### Data connected to a Foodsoft instance

If you start using your Foodsoft instance you will probably enter personal infomation about your members.
These data may consists of real names, email addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers and information about
a member's virtual balance. We store these data inside a database at our servers. Only members of the hosting team
are able to access these data. The databases are not accessable from outside the server and we do our best to protect
the server against attacks.

### Logging

To ensure safe operation and protect against [attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search) our servers
collect the following data:
- IP addresses
- Login dates
- Meta data of email connections

We save this data for no longer than only 48 hours.

## Termination of a Foodsoft instance

We may terminate your Foodsoft instance at any time for any reason. Typically, however,
instances are deleted because of lack of activity for more than 18 months. In that case we will
inform about the upcoming deletion by sending a notification to the contact addresses.

## No Warranty

You understand and agree that the global hosting group provides online services “as is” and without
any warranty, express, implied, or statutory. We specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title,
merchantability, fitness for a particularly purpose and non-infringement. We make no warranty as to the
reliability, accessibility, or quality of our services. You agree that the use of our services is at
your sole and exclusive risk.

## Changes to this policy

We reserve the right to change this policy. If we make major changes, we will notify our users in a clear
and prominent manner. Minor changes may only be highlighted in the footer of our website.
