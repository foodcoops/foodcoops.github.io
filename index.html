- excerpt: |-
    <p>A food cooperative is a group of people that buy food from suppliers of their own
    choosing. A collective do-it-yourself supermarket.</p>

    <p>Members order their products online and collect them on a specified day. And all put
    in a bit of work to make that possible. Foodsoft facilitates the process.</p>
