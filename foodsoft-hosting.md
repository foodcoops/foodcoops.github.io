So you want to start a food cooperative? Or you're already part of one, but
would like to have an ordering system that supports what you're doing? Foodsoft
is a web-based software package offering a product catalog, ordering,
accounting, and job scheduling features.

When you'd like to start using Foodsoft, you can request an instance for your
cooperative at one of the hosting providers. Or if you have some technical skills,
you can also run it yourself.


## Global

People from several food cooperatives in Europe came together to start a global
hosting platform for everyone. It is maintained by a few volunteers from different
countries, and hosting costs are paid for by (yearly) donations. They'd be happy
to welcome you on board.

## Austria

In case you're living in Austria, you're in good company. Please feel free to contact
<i>_IG FoodCoops_</i>, they'd be happy to invite you in the national community of food
cooperatives, and provide Foodsoft hosting.

## Netherlands

Several groups in The Netherlands share a
[server](https://order.voedselcollectief.org) to run a modified version of
Foodsoft (the [foodcoop-adam fork](https://github.com/foodcoop-adam/foodsoft)).
This adds a more user-friendly member ordering interface, online payments,
signup, nested article categories, a checkout screen and other improvements. It
is based on an older version of Foodsoft though, and doesn't provide the
delivery and task functionality.

While this is currently available, the changes are slowly merged with the global
hosting option. Also support is minimal. Please consider the global hosting option instead.

## Do-It-Yourself

Since Foodsoft is open source, you can always run your own copy. This requires
some technical skills, but allows you to make your own tweaks and modifications.
And if you need help, the [mailing list](http://foodsoft.51229.x6.nabble.com/foodsoft-discuss-f5.html)
is always there.
