When in 2017 the hosting by [about:source](https://www.aboutsource.net/)
[ended](/2017/04/17/foodsoft-hosting-wird-eingestellt) after [ten years](/2007/06/22/foodsoft-portal-startet/),
members of food cooperatives of three countries [came together](/2017/07/14/open-community-driven-foodsoft-platform/)
to form a global hosting platform.

# Foodsoft

The platform provides the main Foodsoft version, complete with email replies and standard
plugins. There is also a [shared database](#shared-database) of suppliers for some German
and Dutch suppliers (in addition to those managed by your own cooperative).

# Costs

The total costs for maintaing the platform are shared by all cooperatives. Please consider to donate 10 to 20 Euros
on a yearly basis.

Because we don't have a legal status, we've asked [Sense.Lab](https://senselab.org/) to handle
receiving donations. This is a German non-profit involved with several initiatives for a better world.
When donating, please use [their account details](https://senselab.org/spenden), making sure to
mention _foodcoops.net_ and your foodcoop name as a subject in the bank transfer.

# Support

If you have a question about using Foodsoft, you can visit the [user mailing-list](http://foodsoft.274.s1.nabble.com/foodsoft-discuss-f5.html)
(please [search](http://foodsoft.274.s1.nabble.com/template/NamlServlet.jtp?macro=search_page&node=5&query=) before
posting a new message).
Or maybe the [support wiki](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/wiki/Support) has what you need already.

In case you have an issue with the global platform, you can send an email to
[support@lists.foodcoops.net](mailto:support@lists.foodcoops.net),
where the technical team can help resolve it.

# Helping out

The global platform is maintained by volunteers from different cooperatives. If you would
like to help out, please contact!

We're currently looking for people who want to write new documentation for Foodsoft.
Feel free to email either support address.

# Shared database

Some suppliers are used by several cooperatives and have automated article updates by means
of a shared database. Each food cooperative can make a selection of its articles, and synchronize
prices before opening an order. [Read more on the wiki](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/wiki/Shared-database).

The following suppliers are available in the shared database:

* DE - [Terra Naturkost](https://www.terra-natur.com/): organic wholesale retailer.
* NL - [De Nieuwe Band](https://nieuweband.nl/): organic wholesale cooperative for dry foods, cheese and some household goods.
* NL - [BioRomeo](http://www.bioromeo.nl/): farmer collective with organic fruits and vegetables from Flevoland.
