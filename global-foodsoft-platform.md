When in 2017 the hosting by [about:source](https://www.aboutsource.net/)
[ended](/2017/04/17/foodsoft-hosting-wird-eingestellt) after [ten years](/2007/06/22/foodsoft-portal-startet/),
members of food cooperatives of three countries [came together](/2017/07/14/open-community-driven-foodsoft-platform/)
to form a global hosting platform. Since January 2024 the tech collectiv [rokoli](https://roko.li) has been operating
the platform.

# Foodsoft

The platform provides the main Foodsoft version, complete with email replies and standard
plugins. The web interface supports different [languages](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/tree/master/config/locales).
There is also a [shared database](#shared-database) of suppliers for some German
and Dutch suppliers (in addition to those managed by your own cooperative).

# Costs

The total costs for maintaing the platform are shared by all cooperatives. Every cooperative can use up to 5 free Foodsoft
user accounts. For each additional Foodsoft user account a fee of 1 â‚¬ net per month is charged.

# Shared database

Some suppliers are used by several cooperatives and have automated article updates by means
of a shared database. Each food cooperative can make a selection of its articles, and synchronize
prices before opening an order. [Read more on the wiki](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/wiki/Shared-database).

The following suppliers are available in the shared database:

* DE - [Bio Antakya](http://www.bio-antakya.de): organic wholesale retailer. Delivery to allmost all federal states.
* DE - [Naturkost Elkershausen](https://www.naturkost-elkershausen.de): organic wholesale retailer.
* DE - [Terra Naturkost](https://www.terra-natur.com/): organic wholesale retailer.
* NL - [BioRomeo](http://www.bioromeo.nl/): farmer collective with organic fruits and vegetables from Flevoland.
* NL - [Odin](https://www.odin.nl/): organic wholesale cooperative for dry foods, cheese and some household goods.

Please note that your Foodcoop needs to be an approved customer by any of these suppliers to place an order.
